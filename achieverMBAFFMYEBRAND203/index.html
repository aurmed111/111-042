                The Achiever is energetic, possesses high motivation and drive, with strong goal orientation and high productivity. They are competitive and business-like. Achievers are action and results oriented, and focus on the tasks ahead where performance and productivity are key. They are verbally and socially skilful, and sensitive to the latest trends. Achievers are very fast in analysing patterns in discussions and have a feel for which information they can use. Attention to detail is critical to them and they are often described as painstaking, anxious, orderly, conscientious people. Achievers are competitive and able to tolerate a lot of stress. They tend to be neat and tidy, prefer a lot of structure and have a high regard for tradition.

For Achievers, the thrill is in the crisis. They enjoy problem-solving and not necessarily having to rely on other people. The Achiever creates a favourable environment for achievement of targets and good performance. The balance of authority and compassion is key to being an effective Achiever leader. The Achiever tends to shoulder burdens that other bosses might push upon staff.

The Achiever is verbally and socially skilful, and is sensitive to the latest trends. They cleverly use these to make a good impression on people. Their physical appearance, attitude and expressions are designed to fit their environment well. Achievers have the capacity to be liked by people without putting in much effort. They communicate continuously and thereby gradually gain access to important information, which they can use to slightly manipulate their surroundings.

Achievers prefer a business approach to a personal one, but if the situation demands it they can easily adapt their approach. They prefer win-win situations, as you might need someone again in the near future.

Organisations need these individuals to ensure that teams produce high-quality work. Achievers are especially valuable in work environments where precision and adherence to deadlines are essential. It comes naturally to Achievers to want to translate plans into concrete activities and to execute the decisions that have been made.

The Achiever is a perfectionist and will often go the extra mile to make sure everything is “just right”. The deliverables the Achiever produces can be trusted to have been double-checked and then checked again. Achievers have a strong inward sense of the need for accuracy, rarely needing any encouragement from others because their own high standards are what they strive to live up to.

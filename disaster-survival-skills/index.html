Disaster survival is not always the doomsday picture that many imagine: societal collapse, every person for themselves, cities in ruin and lone survivors hiding out in the wilderness.

Natural disasters sweep this planet and are common in many parts of the world, and they can be over in just a few hours or days.

They can be particularly devastating, however, and many people lose their lives each year as a result.

This article refers to a multitude of natural disasters: floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanoes, wildfires and so on.

There is a reasonable level of preparedness to be attained if you live in an area with any threat – however small – of a natural disaster.

These disasters pose a serious threat to your home and the safety of your family. In most cases, they can be ridden out in a dedicated survival shelter, bug out location or safe place, but some extreme cases may require you to evacuate your home town entirely.

In this article you will learn how to prepare for disaster survival, what to do during a natural disaster and why survival skills are important.

The key to disaster survival is to be prepared and act quickly, as you may find yourself with very little warning.

With our disaster survival guide you should be one step ahead!    

Disaster survival tips: before a disaster
Be well informed
It is likely that you already know of any threats from natural disasters, if you or your family has lived in your home town for a while.

However, if you are considering moving to a new location, then do your research about the area you are moving to and see if there is anything to be aware of.

The USA is known to being home to many “disaster” hotspots, given that it is so large and hosts many types of terrain.

For other countries where internet resources might not be as abundant, speaking to locals before you immigrate is always a great idea.

If you choose to reside somewhere prone to disasters – then the responsibility is on you to keep you and your loved ones safe by learning emergency survival skills!

Family disaster plan checklist
Having a disaster survival plan ready for you and your family will increase your chances of survival in the chaos and panic of a calamity.
Stock up on supplies
Whatever the disaster, it is likely that you will need a good stock of supplies and disaster survival gear in your safe hideout or Bug Out Bag, so that you can survive for a few days without the comforts of home.

At the very least, you need to make sure you have “the top three” survival supplies: food, water and shelter. There are various ways to stock up when doing disaster survival planning.

Do your research and make a plan which works best for you and your family.

Do emergency drills
This is often a step that people omit from their preparation, but hosting an emergency drill is an important stage in disaster survival.

It will iron out any kinks in your evacuation plan, highlight things you have forgotten and identify areas where you are spending too long and losing time.

It is wise to do drills during the day and night to cover a range of scenarios. Your family may roll their eyes at this but when that inevitable disaster does strike – you’ll be their hero!

Disaster survival tips: during a disaster
Bugging in vs bugging out?
The hardest decision that many families must make during a disaster is to know whether to stay at home in their safe space (bug in) or abandon their property and seek safer ground (bug out).

In some scenarios – such as earthquakes or tornadoes – it is almost always advised to stay at home, as you simply cannot outrun these disasters, the warning is simply too short.

However, many other disaster scenarios will force you to make a decision one way or another, knowing that lives are at stake.

Each scenario is so specific that there is no general rule, but the best advice is to take a moment to calm yourself, stay level headed and think it through.

If you have time to leave the house then you have time to take 30 seconds to make a thorough decision; not one made out of panic.

Essential survival gear to pack in case of a disaster bug out
Try to keep spirits up
It might seem like an obvious thing to say, but keeping everyone’s spirits high if you are locked in a bunker or driving away from a danger is imperative, especially if you are with children.

Focusing on the danger outside and speaking in panicked tones can be hugely unsettling for some people. If you are able to do so, take minds of the issue by playing cards, reading together or playing games to pass the time.

Maintaining a sense of normality whilst you wait out the danger can help to soothe nerves and create a safe space, so that people don’t act irrationally or from fear.

Turn off electricity
House fires can start if your electrical sockets come in to contact with water, metal or other substances.

Floods, tornadoes and earthquakes are especially known for causing damage to electrical outlets, due to water contact and falling debris.

Electrical fires can often start small and go unnoticed for a while – especially if you are taking cover in another part of the house.

Always turn your household power off at the source before you leave to eliminate this risk - unless you have zero time and need to leave the house immediately!

You don’t want to return from a traumatic three days in your emergency bunker to find that your house burned down and it could have been avoided.......

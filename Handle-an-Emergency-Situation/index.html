An emergency is any situation that poses an immediate threat to a person's health, security, property, or environment. Knowing how to assess the signs that make up an emergency will help you know how to handle it. In addition, being well-prepared for an emergency will pay off when it's time to handle any emergency situation.

Step 1 Remain calm.
1
Remain calm. Although emergencies require rapid action, the most important factor in effectively handling the situation is to keep calm. If you find yourself becoming confused or anxious, stop what you're doing. Take a few deep breaths to help yourself relax. Remember that to be calm in a stressful situation you must deliberately adjust your behavior. Acting calm will also help other people nearby relax as well. Reassure yourself that you can handle the situation.[1]
The reason you feel panicked in an emergency is the result of your body's automatic overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol. The cortisol goes to the brain and slows down the pre-frontal cortex, which is the region responsible for planning complex action.
By overriding your body's reaction, you can continue to access your critical thinking faculties. You won't be responding from emotion but from rational thought. Look around and assess the situation to see what needs to be done before acting.
Step 2 Seek additional help.
2
Seek additional help. In the USA, call 911 for emergency assistance. Use whatever number applies to call emergency services outside the U.S. This phone number will reach an emergency dispatcher who will need to know your location and the nature of the emergency.
Answer all of the questions the dispatcher asks. The job of the dispatcher is to provide quick, appropriate emergency response. She can only do this by asking these questions.
If you're calling on a traditional telephone or a GPS-equipped cell phone, emergency services may be able to track your location even if you're unable to speak. Even if you can't talk, call emergency services and someone will be able to find you to provide help.
It may be a good idea to go over how you would communicate during an emergency, especially if you have a reason to expect an emergency might arise.
Step 3 Determine the nature of the emergency.
3
Determine the nature of the emergency. What signs indicate that there is an emergency? Is this a medical emergency, or is there a threat to the property/building that may result in human injury? It's important to stop and take inventory of the situation calmly before reacting to the emergency.[2]
An injury due to a motor vehicle accident, smoke inhalation, or burns from a fire are examples of medical emergency situations.
A medical emergency consists of sudden physical symptoms, such as seizure, intense bleeding, head trauma, loss of consciousness, chest pain, lack of breath or pulse, choking, sudden dizziness, or weakness.
Intense desire to hurt yourself or someone else constitutes a mental health emergency.
Other mental health changes may also be considered an emergency, such as sudden changes in behavior or experiencing confusion, which can be an emergency if they occur without cause.
Behavioral emergencies are best met by remaining calm, watching from a short distance, and encouraging the person in crisis to stay calm as well. This way you can react appropriately if the situation becomes volatile.
Step 4 Know that sudden changes can be emergencies.
4
Know that sudden changes can be emergencies. Chemical spills, fires, breaking water pipes, electrical outages, natural disasters such as floods or fires are all examples of potential workplace emergencies. If you have advanced warning of the possibility of an emergency, such as the warning of a flood, heavy snow, tornado, etc., you may be better prepared. However, the nature of an emergency is to be unexpected.[3]
When assessing emergency situations, be aware that the situation may be volatile. It may change rapidly.
If you have advance warning of an emergency, prepare ahead of time for the best results.
Step 5 Be alert for human-caused emergencies.
5
Be alert for human-caused emergencies. Assaults or threats of violence at a workplace or home are emergencies that call for rapid response. In most cases, there are no predictable patterns or methods for these emergencies. These situations tend to be unpredictable, and they change quickly.[4]
If you find yourself in an emergency of this nature, keep yourself safe. Run to a safe location, or find shelter in place. Do not fight, except as a last resort.
Being attentive to warning signs in your workplace, including any act of physical violence (pushing, shoving, etc.) should be immediate. Your office should have a procedure for workplace violence, including a phone number you can call to report the situation. If you don't know your office's procedures, ask your supervisor or a trusted coworker.
Open, honest communication between employees and supervisors is part of maintaining a safe, healthy workplace.
Step 6 Assess the immediate threat.
6
Assess the immediate threat. For example, if one person appears injured, are you or anyone else in danger of also being injured? For example, if one person is caught in a machine, is the machine turned off? If there has been a chemical spill, is the spill spreading towards anyone else? Is the person caught in a structure that's collapsing?
If the threat isn't contained, this will affect your response.
Be aware that any emergency situation may change abruptly, so ongoing assessment is required.
Step 7 Remove yourself from danger.
7
Remove yourself from danger. If you, or others, are at risk of being harmed, leave the situation immediately. If you have an evacuation plan, follow it. Go to an area where you will be safe.
In a situation where you cannot leave, find the safest possible location within your given area. For example, hiding beneath a solid surface, such as a desk or table, may help if there is a chance of being hit by falling debris.
If you're near a car accident, make sure you're not in the line of oncoming traffic. Get off the road.
Be aware that in an emergency, elements are likely to change quickly. In your assessment, notice if volatile or combustible elements are present. For example, in an auto accident, gasoline may catch fire abruptly.
Step 8 Help others leave a hazardous area.
8
Help others leave a hazardous area. If you can safely assist someone else in leaving a dangerous situation, do so. If returning to the emergency situation is risky, a trained rescue person may be better equipped to retrieve anyone in harm's way.
Offering verbal reassurance to an injured person if he is conscious will help another person, even if you can't move them. Let that person know who you are and what is happening to them. Ask them questions to keep them conscious.
If the emergency is stable, stay with the victim.

Step 1 Determine if you can do anything to help.
1
Determine if you can do anything to help. The most important thing you can do is to remain calm, stay in control of the situation, and call for help. Sometimes there is nothing that you can do, and that's fine. Don't be worried about admitting that there's nothing you can do to help.
If others on the scene are upset or fearful, reassure them. Employ them in going to get help.
It's better to remain with someone in a supportive way than to do an action that may result in additional damage. If you're not sure what to do, simply stay with the person. If possible, take their pulse, make notes of events as they happen, and ask them about their medical history. This is information you may need when talking to the emergency team.
Step 2 Take time to think before acting.
2
Take time to think before acting. Being in an emergency situation can result in panicked thinking and actions. Instead of reacting to a situation, take time to calm down. Breathe deeply before you take any action.
Things change suddenly in emergency situations. Don't panic if things suddenly go in a different direction than you'd expected.
Take time to pause whenever you're overwhelmed, panicky, or confused. If you need to stop in the middle of taking an action to calm down, that's okay......

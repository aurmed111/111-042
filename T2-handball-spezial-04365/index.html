                Although 2023 might have been the year of the Samba, it's a different adidas terrace silhouette which has been catching our eye in 2024. So far this year, the Handball Spezial has been the breakout silhouette from the Three Stripes brand. We've seen demand for the silhouette increase by over 90% when compared to last year, and it's easy to see why. Coming in at an affordable price of Â£85, and with plenty of incredible colourways to choose from, the Handball Spezial is shaping up to be the must have shoe for the Spring/Summer season.

If you haven't already picked up a pair of Spezials, now is the perfect time! Hype for the shoe is still building, which means you can quite easily get your hands on a pair without having to enter any raffles. Although there are some in-demand colourways right now which are hard to get your hands on (thanks Molly-Mae), there are also some new releases which seem to be slipping under the radar.

Learn the types of disasters or emergencies that may likely occur in your area. These events can range from those affecting only you and your family, like a home fire or medical emergency, to those affecting your entire community, like an earthquake or flood.

Identify how local authorities will notify you during a disaster and how you will get information, whether through local radio, TV or NOAA Weather Radio stations or channels. (Visit the Red Cross Store to shop for NOAA Weather Radios)
Know the difference between different weather alerts such as watches and warnings and what actions to take in each.
Know what actions to take to protect yourself during disasters that may occur in areas where you travel or have moved recently. For example, if you travel to a place where earthquakes are common and you are not familiar with them, make sure you know what to do to protect yourself should one occur.
When a major disaster occurs, your community can change in an instant. Loved ones may be hurt and emergency response is likely to be delayed. Make sure that at least one member of your household is trained in first aid and CPR and knows how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). This training is useful in many emergency situations.

Create Emergency Contact Cards for All Household Members
Print one card for each family member.
Write the contact information for each household member, such as work, school and cell phone numbers.
Fold the card so it fits in your pocket, wallet or purse.
Carry the card with you so it is available in the event of a disaster or other emergency.
Download the emergency contact card template

Be ready.
Shop the Red Cross store for emergency kits, radios, and more.

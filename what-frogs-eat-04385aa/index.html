            <p>


Frogs are truly generalist predators—they’ll eat just about anything that comes their way in the wild. They’ll eat spiders, grasshoppers, butterflies—essentially anything that fits in their mouth. Aquatic frogs eat a variety of aquatic invertebrates.</p>

<p>Each species of frog has specific nutritional guidelines, but in general, your pet frog will eat a mix of the following.</p>

<p>1. Crickets</p>
<p>Crickets will form the backbone of your pet frog’s diet. That’s not because they’re the healthiest—it’s just because they’re easiest to purchase or raise at home. Make sure to gut-load them prior to feeding your frog.</p>

<p>2. Mealworms and Waxworms</p>
<p>These are another tasty snack for frogs. Like crickets, mealworms are pretty easy to find at pet stores or raise at home. You can also purchase them at bait stores for fishing, but those won’t be gut-loaded.</p>

<p>3. Locusts and Grasshoppers</p>
<p>Locusts and grasshoppers can be a bit trickier to find in pet stores or purchase for your frog, but they add much-needed nutritional variety to your pet’s diet.</p>

<p>4. Caterpillars or Worms</p>
<p>These are getting easier to find in pet stores for purchase. Be sure to purchase caterpillars that are the correct size for your frog, as they can be quite large.

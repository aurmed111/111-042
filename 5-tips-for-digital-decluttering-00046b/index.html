             You are having a great day—productive yet carefree. You open your closet door to put something away when out of the corner of your eye you glimpse what looks like a nest of black snakes interwoven with flecks of silver. The snakes morph before your eyes into a Medusa’s head of abandoned computer cords that threatens to turn you into stone if you keep looking at them. And they have names: USB, FireWire, pin-dot, 2-pin. And the cords connect to so many obsolete devices: your old digital camera, that practically antique PalmPilot, your grandma’s dot-matrix printer, your shattered iPhone 3. This is a monster pile of digital detritus, and it’s time for it to go.

THE GOT SYNDROME
In the past 10 years, the speed of innovation has increased exponentially. Periodic upgrades have become expected and anticipated, leading to a constant churn of hardware. While it’s easy to acquire new gadgets, it is significantly harder to know what to do with the old ones. As a result, we are burdened with what I call the GOT (guilt over things) syndrome. The GOT syndrome makes us feel like we have to keep objects because they might be useful again someday, they have sentimental value or they are worth a lot of money.
 
It’s hard to let go of a gadget that you spent $600 on just a year ago, only to find that its value plummeted as soon as the next model came out. It’s also difficult to get rid of gadgets that carry sensitive data, particularly when an item is broken. And so, these Medusa heads made up of gadgets and gizmos pile up in dark closets, their very existence in our homes proving that the stone-turning effect really works—we are paralyzed by our fear of letting go.

The benefits of mental downtime
1. Less stress and anxiety
We’re humans, not machines. And there’s only so much that the human brain can cope with.

Responding to the constant stimulation and demands of technology is not only exhausting, it’s a major contributor to chronic stress and anxiety.

Whether you struggle with stress and anxiety in general, or you’re currently experiencing a bad bout, taking enough time away from work, technology, and life responsibilities is a must.

Give yourself time to process and recover. This way, you’ll feel less stressed, you’ll be better able to handle challenges as they arise, and you’ll have more energy to devote to your work, your life, and your loved ones.

2. Reduced risk of burnout
Burnout poses a serious threat to your mental well-being, and sadly, it’s not an uncommon experience. 65% of people have experienced work-related burnout at some point in their lives.

Burnout slowly destroys our ability to function and weakens our immune systems, impacting our overall performance, health, and well-being. Though it can come on quickly, it often takes a very long time to recover from.

When we’re constantly on the go mentally and physically, our minds and bodies don’t get a chance to recover, making burnout an unfortunate inevitability.

By responding to how you’re feeling and pumping the breaks on work and other stressors, you can avoid the adverse effects of burnout.

3. Increased creativity
Whether you’re in a creative industry or not, creativity is a meaningful part of the human experience.

But when we’re receiving constant external stimulation and don’t take a moment to pause and tap into our creativity, this important side of ourselves starts to suffer.

It’s true that boredom is essential to our creativity – and these days, we don’t get much opportunity to be bored. Unconscious mental activity like driving or doing the dishes is fundamental to resting our brains and letting those creative juices flow.

Creativity has a wonderful effect on mental health and well-being. Unplugging from technology and switching off from work are great ways to allow your creativity to flourish.

4. Better personal relationships
Brain health plays a major role in our relationships. If you’re not looking after your mental health, you won’t be able to cope with your own needs, let alone the needs of your loved ones.

The default mode network (DMN) is a part of the brain that’s activated when we’re lost in thought, as opposed to taking in and responding to what’s going on around us. Some DMN brain activity (like daydreaming) is useful for our creativity. But, spending too much time stuck in negative thought cycles and mental rabbit holes can be detrimental to our relationship with ourselves and with others.

Stress, overthinking, and exhaustion all impact our ability to be patient and communicate effectively. And while taking a break from obsessive thoughts isn’t always easy, learning to catch them when they happen can make your life so much easier. Make sure to take the time you need to unwind so you can function the way you want to in your relationships.

5. Better cognitive function
If you feel like you simply don’t have the time to take your mind off work and your personal obligations, we can relate. And you’re definitely not alone. But when we’re overworked and exhausted, our basic mental processes, working memory, and ability to solve problems take a hit.

Prioritizing downtime actually allows us to function better than if we plow through at a lower capacity.

When you take a breather and come back to your responsibilities refreshed, not only can you tackle tasks and challenges better, but you’ll have more energy to stay focused, energized, and motivated – and your productivity will improve in the long run.

6. Better physical health
There’s no denying how connected the mind and body are. So, if you want to look after your physical well-being, you’ve got to make your mental health a priority, too.

Mental downtime gives us a clearer mind, improves our mood, and simply makes it easier to get through the day.

An improved mental state also leads to better sleep, reduced heart rate, and a decreased desire to stress-eat. Prioritizing downtime is not only important for your cognitive function and emotional health, but an important part of looking after your overall health and well-being.

            It’s easy to get frustrated by the incessant rings, dings and pop-up messages of the tech in our lives. Technology helps us communicate faster and work better, but it can also become an albatross. Researchers are beginning to study exactly how it affects happiness and emotional development in the long run. So far, the results from academic studies have been a wake-up call: Teens who spend hours online become less happy; the mere presence of a cellphone during a face-to-face conversation can reduce feelings of closeness, trust and relationship quality.

While these findings should give us pause, there is another side to the story—about how technology can (and is) being used to improve communication. Think of the numerous geographically divided families that can now communicate on FaceTime or Skype for a fraction of the cost, or of far-flung friends who now stay in touch via Facebook or Snapchat.        

POSITIVE NEWS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA                  
Keith Hampton, a professor of media and information at Michigan State University, argues that the idea that we interact either online or offline is a false dichotomy. Through his studies, he has become convinced that social media and the internet are actually drawing us closer together—both online and offline.

“I don’t think it’s people moving online, I think it’s people adding the digital mode of communication to already existing relationships,” he says. The more different kinds of media that people use to interact—phone, email, in person, text, Facebook—the stronger their relationships tend to be. Similarly, a 2012 Pew research study of more than 2,200 individuals in the U.S. found that 55 percent of internet users say their email exchanges have improved their connections to family members, and 66 percent say the same thing for significant friends. Sixty percent of users cite email communication as a primary reason for this improvement.      
If we know that social media has the potential to positively or negatively impact our relationships, the next step is to think more carefully both about what we are consuming online and what we are spreading. Individuals who actively invest in others are 40 percent more likely to receive social support themselves.

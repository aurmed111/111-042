            <p>

Although emergencies can be scary, you're never alone when a disaster strikes. In crises, you have many ways to contact loved ones, reach emergency services, or stay updated on the news. Depending on the situation, you can use your phone or other emergency electronics during a disaster. These, along with the right communication strategies, can help you stay in touch with your community no matter what happens.


Method
1
Using Phones in Emergencies
Step 1 Charge your cell phone if you know an emergency is coming.
1
Charge your cell phone if you know an emergency is coming. If you're preparing for an emergency, charge your cell phone. Purchase a car charger to use once you run out of batteries, especially if the power may go out, and keep a few spare batteries on hand.[1]
If you're charging a phone with your car, never turn it on in enclosed place. Use running cars outdoors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.[2]
Step 2 Forward landline calls to your cellphone.
2
Forward landline calls to your cellphone. Contact your phone service company to ask about forwarding landline calls to your mobile phone. That way, you'll be more likely to receive all important calls during a power outage.[3]
If you can't reach your phone company, you may be able to activate call forwarding online or through your phone's settings.
Step 3 Subscribe to a local text alert services.
3
Subscribe to a local text alert services. Ask your local authorities about any official emergency text alert services. Sign up for any available alert services to stay updated on breaking news as it happens.[4]
Contact your local authorities or police for specific instructions on how to subscribe to their text alerts.
Sign up for school district emergency alert services as well if you have children.
Step 4 Text instead of call whenever possible to keep the lines clear.
4
Text instead of call whenever possible to keep the lines clear. If you have a non-emergency message during a citywide disaster, send a text message to keep the network lines clear. As long as you have service, your phone should be able to send text messages with no or minor delays.[5]
Because most emergency phone numbers do not offer a texting option, call them unless you know your area's emergency services offer a texting option.[6]
Step 5 Purchase a satellite phone to use in case of emergencies.
5
Purchase a satellite phone to use in case of emergencies. Satellite phones connect to orbiting satellites instead of grounded cell sites and can call, text, and load basic Internet sites. Switch to a satellite phone or keep one on hand in case of emergencies where landline or mobile phones may be unavailable.
You can buy satellite phones online or from many electronics or outdoor survival stores.

Finding Alternate Modes of Communication
Step 1 Use social media to connect quickly during emergencies.
1
Use social media to connect quickly during emergencies. If you have internet access, social media is a quick way to message people all around the world. Check your social media daily to receive updates from friends and city authorities.[7]
Some social media sites also allow you to "check in" and tell loved ones that you are okay following an emergency.
Step 2 Use a portable TV for news updates.
2
Use a portable TV for news updates. If you can't access your phone, portable TVs broadcast local emergency updates and weather forecasts. Keep one nearby in case of emergencies, preferably one that is solar- or battery-powered.[8]

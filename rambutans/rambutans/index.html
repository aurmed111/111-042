Rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) is a highly perishable and nonclimacteric tropical fruit, which is appreciated for the exotic flavor of its juicy and sweet pulp. Despite its increasing demand, commercialization is limited by moisture loss during storage and pericarp browning.

Martínez-Castellanos et al. [137] evaluated the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum alone or in combination with 2% low molecular weight chitosan (171.4 kDa, 15% degree of acetylation) on quality and color retention of rambutan fruits stored at 25°C and 10°C, and 75% RH for 10 and 15 days, respectively. Fruits were packaged in clamshells with six holes of 0.9 cm inner diameter at each side of the box. The development of the microorganisms was evidenced by viability analyses and lactic acid production. The application of L. plantarum significantly improved color retention and reduced weight losses. The lactobacilli, alone or in combination with chitosan, preserved fruit quality characteristics such as firmness, total soluble solids, and titratable acidity. The lactobacilli application on rambutan produced acidification of pericarp and avoided browning, thereby preventing desiccation due to biofilm formation.

            <p>
It’s easy to assume that if you’re the same age as someone, you’ve had similar life experiences. That holds up to some extent; people start and end school at roughly the same time, for example. But while life’s milestones represent moments of relatability, they neglect the unique experiences that shaped who we were as individuals at that time. And this is why looking beyond demographic consumer data is so crucial to really knowing your audience.

By digging deeper into psychographics, we can explore how consumers really feel, and where key differences in their views, habits, lifestyles, and preferences lie. So when it comes to Gen Z, one of the most diverse audiences around, what’s fact and what’s fiction? We’re here to set the record straight. 

Who are Generation Z?
Gen Z are the generation after millennials, and before Gen Alpha, so roughly speaking, they were born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. 

They’re the first generation of “digital natives”, never knowing a world without the internet. This, coupled with the fact they had a worldwide pandemic and a cost of living crisis to contend with during their formative years, has profoundly impacted their personality and values, making them a fascinating audience to get to grips with. Here are 8 Gen Z characteristics worth knowing – according to real consumer data.

How to create an effective emergency plan
Forming an effective emergency plan is a crucial factor to ensuring safety in any unpredictable or unlikely event. With a comprehensive emergency plan in place, planning ahead can improve safety and reduce stress should an emergency arise.

Identify the types of emergencies you may face in your area: The Philippines is prone to natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and floods. Knowing what types of emergencies you may face will help you tailor your plan to your specific needs.
Develop a communication plan: It’s important to establish a way to communicate with your family and loved ones during an emergency. Make sure everyone knows the plan and has access to important phone numbers and contact information.
Prepare an emergency kit: Assemble an emergency kit that contains important items such as food, water, first aid supplies, and other necessities. Consider including items that are specific to your area, such as a whistle in case of flooding.
Plan for evacuation: If evacuation is necessary, make sure you have a plan in place. Know the best routes to take and have a designated meeting place for your family. Consider having a “go bag” prepared with essential items in case you need to leave quickly.

Resources for education and training
In times of crisis and emergency, resources for education and training become even more important in order to help those affected find stability and a sense of normality at life. Here in the Philippines, there are plenty of options available when it comes to finding quality education and training during emergencies such as natural disasters or political upheavals.

Tip 3: Keep Emergency Supplies Handy

It is important to have supplies that can sustain you for at least 3 days as well as prevent injury or illness. Stock up with items such as food and water, flashlights, medical supplies, tools, copies of vital documents like birth certificates and passports and extra clothing.

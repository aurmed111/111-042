Kabocha squash is a small to medium-sized winter squash with a hard, dark green skin and sweet flavor, commonly prepared by simply roasting. It can be used in all kinds of sweet and savory dishes, like soups, stews, casseroles, and curries, as well as muffins, quick breads, pies, and cookies.
Also known as Japanese pumpkin, kabocha squash grows to around 9 to 12 inches in diameter, and weighs 3 to 4 pounds. It is a variety of Cucurbita maxima, which also includes Hubbard squash, banana squash, and buttercup squash. It is grown and eaten extensively in Japan, where it is enjoyed baked and grilled, in cakes, soups, jams, and pies, and as an ingredient in tempura. 

Kabocha squash are notable for their dark green skin, with white speckles or streaks, along with its bright orange flesh and firm, dry texture. The flavor is remarkable, and among the sweetest of all squash and pumpkins. The texture is sometimes compared to that of a sweet potato. The shape is fairly round, and smooth, with few ridges, along with fibrous pulp and flat, cream-colored seeds that can be roasted to eat as a snack or for garnish. The flavor offers hints of chestnuts, and is enhanced by roasting. 

Kabocha squash is enjoyed throughout Asia, including in Korea, where it is used for making sweet rice porridge, and in Thailand, where it is a common ingredient in custards and other desserts, as well as curries. In Japanese cuisine, in addition to tempura, kabocha is frequently paired with miso paste, and is a favorite ingredient in shabu-shabu, or hotpot dishes, and for making croquettes.

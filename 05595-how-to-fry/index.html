               Then, let them sit in the hot water. As soon as the water begins to boil, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Leave the eggs in the hot water for anywhere from 10-12 minutes, depending on how you like your eggs. The 10-minute eggs will have vibrant, creamy yolks, while the 12-minute yolks will be paler and opaque, with a chalkier texture.

Everyone likes their eggs differently, and that's ok! I, along with many others, prefer my yolks runnyâ€”which is why I usually go the sunny-side-up or over-easy route. In both, the whites are set and the yolks are runny. The difference is that over-easy eggs are flipped before removing from the pan, while sunny-side-up eggs only cook on one side. Eggs over-medium and over-hard just require longer cook time on their flipped side so the yolk is semi or completely cooked, respectively.

              What can happen in one moment? A lot. What impact can a small change bring? Huge. Most of us dream a lot, but we do not achieve them as we are not ready to make big changes. But what if I tell you that small and consistent efforts over time can bring substantial results? We often ignore the power of a small step that can eventually take our life to a higher scale.

Remember, “Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction can be the biggest step of your life.”

To illustrate, I will tell you the story of Jadav Payeng, the Forest Man of India. He started planting a tree every day, a small step, you may say, but he continued for 30 years and created a forest of more than 1360 hectares. He single-handedly transformed the area and saved Majuli Island.

A step a day
The secret to success is taking the first step and keep moving towards the goal. Even if you are making little progress, over the years, it will have a huge impact on your life. Be it eating healthier or exercising more every day, doing 1% more will ensure 37% growth in a year.

Always remember that success is a process, and you have to be persistent to achieve it.

Keep up the pace
Most people find big changes overwhelming, and hence their goals remain unachieved. However, if you start small and keep on working hard, your goals will seem easy to accomplish. Break up your target in small chunks and bring small changes to achieve them. If you are persistent with your efforts, very soon you can see your dream materializing into reality.

Celebrate your success
How do you ensure giving your best? By celebrating your success. Maybe you are successful in waking up 30 minutes early every day or exercising 10 minutes before heading to the office.

Celebrate the small changes you are making to increase the momentum. As you applaud your efforts, you will feel motivated, and bringing more changes will become easier.

A small step out of your comfort zone will open a new world of opportunities for you. Don’t deny yourself that pleasure. One day you will witness the result and feel proud for taking that first baby step.
